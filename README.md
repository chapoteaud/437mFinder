I wanted to find these wheels (https://f30.bimmerpost.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=2342826&stc=1&d=1592587703) for my car. I didn't want to keep checking the BMW forums every day so, like the efficient (re: lazy) person I am, I automated it!

This program scrapes the F30post and F80post (local CA) forums and sends me a text when it finds people selling the 437m wheels.

Was I able to find the wheels....yes!
