I wanted to find these wheels (https://f30.bimmerpost.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=2342826&stc=1&d=1592587703) for my car. I didn't want to keep checking the BMW forums every day so, like the efficient (re: lazy) person I am, I automated it!

I have a rasberry pi that I've loaded Linux on and want to use as my server. The idea was to set up a cron job to run this on a schedule (interval: every 4 hrs).

Was I able to find the wheels....yes!
